 * Please refer to the following link for HashMap use:
 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html
 * <p>
 * Basically, this is like an ArrayList but it's a Hashmap. You would use this
 * like how you would use an ArrayList or LinkedList or any data structures.

 * Refactored from HashMap to ArrayList.
